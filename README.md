2. **Real-time Insights**: It provides real-time data monitoring and the ability to view up-to-date information, which is crucial for timely decision-making.

3. **Accessibility**: Users can access Power BI reports from any device, ensuring data is available anytime, anywhere.

4. **Integration**: Power BI integrates seamlessly with various data sources, including Excel, SQL Server, and cloud services, allowing for comprehensive data analysis.

5. **User-Friendly**: Its intuitive interface allows users of all skill levels to create and share reports, promoting data-driven decision-making across the organization.

Overall, Power BI enhances business intelligence capabilities, fostering a data-driven culture that can lead to improved business outcomes and a competitive edge.

# Background

The Data came from the survey is not that good so i decided to clean it up and make sure to save the important data that i'll be using later on analysis and visualization using Power BI.
Then provide a breakdown report using different graph to visualize it precisely that can help to make an accurate results.

I learned alot on Power BI by practising it, from raw files then came up with breakdown visualization.
## The question I Wanted to answer through my project Power BI:
  1. What are the average salary base on their job?
